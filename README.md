Week one Homework

Hello!

The more of these programs I must install the more nervous I am becoming about this class.
As someone who has very little experience with computer coding in any way, this is going to be 
a great learning exercise. I currently work as a Senior Engineer with a government contractor. In my 
current position I am having to examine a lot of data using excel, which isnâ€™t that bad. The area I def 
struggle with is writing code to gather data then quickly sort through it.
